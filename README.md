# SMTAdapt
Based on Slazanger's Eve Map Tool

This is a fork of the awesome SMT Map-Tool for Eve Online written by Slazanger. 
I am currently trying to add an overview window to the tool that will show a tiered overview of
the systems up to a set distance and highlights systems with intel reported. This is intended to
make it easier to keep track of your intel without looking away from your eve window since it will
be transparent and on top of it.
